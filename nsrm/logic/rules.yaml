# Logic constraints for the Sanity Check experiment
# Format: Simple assertions about relations
# These will be used to reward the graph structure

rules:
  # Rule: A numerical progression implies a successor relation
  - rule_name: "linear_progression"
    condition: "is_numeric_sequence"
    required_relation: "next_step"
    nodes: ["1", "2", "3", "4", "5"] # Simplified for the specific experiment

  # Rule: Disjoint concepts (sanity check)
  # If we were modeling objects, we might say:
  # - rule_name: "distinct_objects"
  #   condition: "different_class"
  #   forbidden_relation: "is_same_as"
